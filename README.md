# DayBook ‚Äì DevOps & DevSecOps Practice Project

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:**  
This project is **not originally developed by me**. The core MERN application was created by the original author [thenileshnishad](https://github.com/thenileshnishad/daybook).  
I am using this project **only for learning purposes** to implement and practice **DevOps and DevSecOps best practices**.

## üöÄ What I‚Äôm Practicing in This Project

This repository serves as a hands-on learning ground to enhance my **DevOps & DevSecOps** skills by integrating various tools, technologies, and workflows.

### üîß DevOps Practices
- **Containerization**: Dockerizing frontend and backend services.
- **Orchestration**: Deployments using Kubernetes (K8s).
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated build, test, and deployment using **Jenkins / GitHub Actions / GitLab CI**.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing infrastructure with **Terraform**.
- **Configuration Management**: Automating setup with **Ansible**.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Setting up **Prometheus + Grafana** for system metrics and alerts.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploying services on **AWS Free Tier** (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.).

### üõ°Ô∏è DevSecOps Practices
- **Static Code Analysis**: Using **SonarQube** and **ESLint** for code quality and bug detection.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Identifying vulnerable packages with **Trivy** and **npm audit**.
- **Container Security**: Scanning Docker images with **Trivy**.
- **Secrets Management**: Handling sensitive data with **.env files**, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes Secrets.
- **Secure CI/CD**: Adding security gates in pipelines (fail on high-severity vulnerabilities).
- **Monitoring & Alerting for Security**: Integrating security alerts with monitoring dashboards.

## üìö Learning Objectives

By working on this project, I aim to:

- Strengthen my **CI/CD pipeline design** skills.
- Apply **DevSecOps principles** to ensure code, dependencies, and containers are secure.
- Gain real-world experience with **Kubernetes, Terraform, and Ansible**.
- Improve **cloud deployment** practices while staying cost-optimized.

## üìù Note

- The original MERN stack application belongs to [thenileshnishad](https://github.com/thenileshnishad/daybook).  
- My contribution is focused purely on **DevOps and DevSecOps** workflows.  
- No intention of claiming ownership of the application code itself.
